# Post Pulse

Post Pulse is a simple blog web application built using Node.js, Express.js, and EJS. This application allows users to create, view, edit, and delete blog posts. Posts do not persist between sessions as no database is used in this version. The application is well-styled to ensure a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
